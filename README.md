🛡️ CyberSentinel

CyberSentinel is a real-time browser extension that protects users from digital threats while ensuring complete privacy. It analyzes websites, IPs, and emails using multiple free threat intelligence APIs to detect phishing, malware, IP abuse, and data breaches — before harm can occur.

 🧠 How It Works

CyberSentinel uses trusted, free threat intelligence APIs to cross-check:

* URLs visited in the browser
* IP addresses your device connects to
* Emails you enter into websites or forms

If a threat is detected, CyberSentinel immediately notifies you with clear, actionable alerts.

APIs used may include:

* AbuseIPDB
* VirusTotal
* HaveIBeenPwned
* PhishTank
  *(API keys and usage may vary)

🔐 Privacy First

* No personal data is sent to our servers.
* All threat checks are done locally or directly via API.
* We don’t track, log, or sell user activity.
